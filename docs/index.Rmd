## Introduction

### AIS: Automatic Identification System

+ intended to assist a vessel's watchstanding officers and allow maritime authorities to track and monitor vessel movements
+ info such as unique identification, position, course, and speed; sent in tight intervals by every vessel

## Inspiration

* One or many messages - baked into lines in a log file - are to be read and decoded 
* Tidyverse `readr` offers `read_lines()` and can read from text streams
* If there are parsing issues - inspect them with `readr::problems()`

> Let's do it like that! 

* The reference materials mentions `ais.py` - a file somewhere on the Internet
* Let's use that one - maybe we can call it with `reticulate` from R?

## Lessons

### Data and python issues

* Laptop crash! -> new laptop - this old one doesn't like `reticulate` - memory leaks?
* Log example data contains (timestamp, message) tuples but also other junk
* Big differences in data between ships (7000/10000 from one little coast guard boat, NAs)
* Wrapping `ais.py` needs a timestamp to link messages to the original log
* So this needs a small edit of the `ais.py` file to add this to the JSON output
* Turns out `ais.py` works well but the JSON could be more detailed

### Package development

* Rebuilding vignettes and reloading package documentation is shaky
* Live with restarting R session and wiping environment for the vignettes
* A vignette can be a flexdashboard - but can get big embedding data, would annoy CRAN

## Results

Repo: [https://github.com/mskyttner/vikingr](https://github.com/mskyttner/vikingr)


### Functions

* Function to read the log
* Function to decode the AIS message(s)

### Data

* Sample data from Visby Harbor
* Should work with other sample dataset

### Visuals

* Flexdashboard with leaflet map
